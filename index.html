                              professional program where I earned a techdegree from Team Treehouse in Front End Web Development.
                              To add, I possess certificates and experience in responsive web design, data structures and algorithms for JavaScript, as
                              well as SEO and Digital marketing.

                                             for several months. I have helped guide him on his journey; he has come a
                                             long way since we first met. He has a core understanding of HTML, CSS, and
                                             JavaScript from the projects I have reviewed. It is my professional belief
                                             that he will be a great asset to any team. He is technically savvy and has a
                                             very positive attitude. In addition, he is very approachable, and from my
                                             management perspective, approachable people are suitable for any team that
                                             wants to succeed. Overall, Jacob is an excellent candidate for any company

                                             Jacob is an extremely motivated person. In his work he envisions what he wants to gain from the experience, establishes goals, and sets out to crush them. As he transitions into a career as a web developer he has created a YouTube page and a Discord community to give back and help other engineers develop their coding & interviewing skills and improve their mentalities. 
                                             Jacob embodies the Air Force core values: Integrity First, Service Before Self, & Excellence. Jacob is the type of developer who utilizes all internal and external resources, and is relentless in his pursuit to write code that makes websites clean, modern & engaging for customers.
                                             I recommend hiring Jacob for front-end/web development positions where he can utilize his growing expertise with HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Bootstrap."

His willingness to make things better and not just leave them the way they are is always inspiring to see and by extension his eagerness to learn about new technologies such as React that may be a better fit for a project is always great. He understands that problems don't always have a binary solution and thus he is always open-minded to learn things from different angles.
                                             If you haven't worked with him yet, I definitely recommend you do soon, because it's likely you won't be able to afford his time and services in the future."

                                             He has multiple projects that make API calls based on user input. This is something I think of as a next level software skill in the "seeking a first dev job" arena. He has other features displaying frontend chops, like modals, dynamically updating page content, and functional programming.
                                             Jacob has a high emotional intelligence, is easy to talk to, smart, and has a genuine passion for coding.
