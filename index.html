                                    for several months. I have helped guide him on his journey; he has come a
                                    long way since we first met. He has a core understanding of HTML, CSS, and
                                    JavaScript from the projects I have reviewed. It is my professional belief
                                    that he will be a great asset to any team. He is technically savvy and has a
                                    very positive attitude. In addition, he is very approachable, and from my
                                    management perspective, approachable people are suitable for any team that
                                    wants to succeed. Overall, Jacob is an excellent candidate for any company
                                    looking for a software developer for their team."

                                        Jacob is an extremely motivated person. In his work he envisions what he wants to gain from the experience, establishes goals, and sets out to crush them. As he transitions into a career as a web developer he has created a YouTube page and a Discord community to give back and help other engineers develop their coding & interviewing skills and improve their mentalities. 
                                        
                                        Jacob embodies the Air Force core values: Integrity First, Service Before Self, & Excellence. Jacob is the type of developer who utilizes all internal and external resources, and is relentless in his pursuit to write code that makes websites clean, modern & engaging for customers.

His willingness to make things better and not just leave them the way they are is always inspiring to see and by extension his eagerness to learn about new technologies such as React that may be a better fit for a project is always great. He understands that problems don't always have a binary solution and thus he is always open-minded to learn things from different angles.

                                        If you haven't worked with him yet, I definitely recommend you do soon, because it's likely you won't be able to afford his time and services in the future."

This is something I think of as a next level software skill in the "seeking a first dev job" arena. He has other features displaying frontend chops, like modals, dynamically updating page content, and functional programming.
                                        
                                        Jacob has a high emotional intelligence, is easy to talk to, smart, and has a genuine passion for coding.

                                to make the site more interactive for the user. It also features a form section where
                                a user can save a message to an employee in local storage. You may also
                                search for an employee, as I there is a filtering mechanism coded in.

                                <strong><span class="large">Professional Gallery:</span></strong> Utilizes Unsplash REST API and filesaver.js to create a UX where
                                they can tap on the description of a photo, activate a modal, and save the desired
                                photo to their device. I also used HTML, CSS, and BootStrap here too. (Getting filesaver.js
                                to work was a great challenge... Be sure to save a few photos!)
